Predicting student engagement with 3D ResNet-18 and weighted cross-entropy loss

The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated moving learning to an online environment.
Automatically detecting students’ engagement in this virtual environment is crucial for
improving the quality of student learning. Students’ engagement level can vary over time
and space, and students show different stages of engagement in online learning. Therefore,
we aim to detect engagement levels using videos of students. This paper presents
an end-to-end deep learning classification model using a 3D Residual Network(ResNet).
The 3D ResNet extracts spatial and temporal features from consecutive video frames.
The model is trained on the DAiSEE dataset’s video frames. We compared our result
with other methods validated on the DAiSEE dataset for engagement detection. Our
proposed method outperformed some of the methods.
